/// Defines the contract for the Unit of Work pattern, coordinating the writing out of changes and the resolution of concurrency problems.
/// <para>
/// In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), the Unit of Work pattern ensures that all changes to aggregates are tracked and persisted as a single business transaction,
/// maintaining consistency and integrity across the domain model.

/// Typically, the <c>DbContext</c> in Entity Framework Core is the concrete implementation of this interface.

/// <para>
/// The Unit of Work pattern allows multiple operations to be performed on the domain model, with all changes being committed or rolled back together.
/// This interface should be implemented in the infrastructure layer and injected into application services or command handlers.
/// </para>

/// Usage example:
/// <code>
/// // Application service or command handler
/// movieRepository.Add(movie);
/// // ... other operations ...
/// await unitOfWork.SaveEntitiesAsync(cancellationToken);
/// </code>
